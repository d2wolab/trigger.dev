### Background job processing platform

</div>

## About This Project

This project is a customized job processing system based on the Trigger.dev platform. It allows you to create and manage long-running background jobs in your applications.

### Key features:

- JavaScript and TypeScript SDK
- No timeouts for background jobs
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Queues and concurrency controls
- Scheduled jobs and cron support
- Full observability with logs and trace views
- React integration for frontend applications
- Realtime API for streaming data
- Job status and metadata tracking
- Customizable alerts
- Elastic scaling
- Compatible with modern tech stacks

## Usage

Create background tasks directly in your codebase for better organization and version control.

```ts
import { task } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

// Define and export your task
export const processData = task({
  // Use a unique ID for each task
  id: "process-data",
  // The main task function
  run: async (payload: { data: any }) => {
    // Long-running code goes here - no timeouts
    const result = await processLargeDataset(payload.data);
    return result;
  },
});
```

## Environment Support

The system supports multiple environments:
- `Development` - for local testing
- `Staging` - for pre-production verification
- `Production` - for live workloads

## Job Monitoring

Monitor all your jobs with detailed logs and trace views to help with debugging and performance analysis.
